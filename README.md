**Overview**

This project is a Fake News Detection system built with Python and machine learning techniques. 
It processes news articles and predicts whether they are real or fake. 
With the growing spread of misinformation, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to combat fake news effectively.

**Features**

--> Combines datasets of real and fake news articles (True.csv and Fake.csv).

--> Preprocesses text data using:

--> Tokenization

--> Stopword removal

--> Stemming with PorterStemmer

  ✅ Converts text into numerical vectors with TF-IDF Vectorizer.
  
  ✅ Trains a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) for classification.
  
  ✅ Evaluates performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

**Technologies Used**

--> Python

--> Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)

--> NLTK (Natural Language Processing)

--> Scikit-learn (Machine Learning models & vectorization)

--> Jupyter Notebook (Interactive development)

**Results**

The system achieves high accuracy in detecting fake news articles and provides a solid base for further enhancements. 
Potential real-world applications include:

--> Social media content moderation

--> Fact-checking tools

--> Journalism platforms

**Dataset**

This project uses the Kaggle Fake News Dataset, which contains real and fake news articles.
